# 🚀 CryptoFlux - Next.js Project

Welcome to the **CryptoFlux** project, a Next.js application designed for cryptocurrency tracking and management. This project is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and utilizes several powerful libraries and APIs to enhance functionality.

## 📦 Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **CoinGecko API**: For fetching real-time cryptocurrency data.
- **NextAuth**: For secure user authentication and session management.
- **Recharts**: For creating responsive charts to visualize cryptocurrency data.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
